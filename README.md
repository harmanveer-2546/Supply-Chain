# Data Insight in Fashion & Beauty Supply Chain

The primary goal of this project is to conduct an extensive analysis of supply chain data, focusing on extracting key insights and identifying opportunities for improvement. Although this initiative is primarily for practice purposes, it aims to explore various components of the supply chain, ranging from operational efficiency to cost management. The objective is to develop a deeper understanding of these processes and propose potential strategic improvements.

### Key Findings:

* Distinct patterns emerged in total revenue, average stock levels, and average lead times across different product types.
  
* Higher revenue generation was often associated with lower stock levels, indicating efficient inventory turnover.
  
* Skincare products exhibited longer lead times, suggesting potential supply chain complexities or higher demand.
  
* Analysis of customer demographics revealed varying preferences and purchasing behaviors across different segments.
  
* Sales trends showed significant variations among these demographic groups within each product category.
  
* Further data collection and analysis are necessary for better insights into the 'Unknown' customer demographic segment.
  
* The analysis revealed how 'Availability' is influenced by factors such as 'Price', 'Number of Products Sold', and 'Lead Times'. Understanding these relationships offers strategic insights for managing inventory levels and planning future stock requirements.

* The interaction between price, sales volume, and lead times appears complex, indicating that changes in one factor could significantly impact product availability. This complexity underscores the need for a nuanced, multi-faceted approach to inventory management and forecasting.

* To enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of demand forecasting, there's a need for further data collection, particularly historical sales data. Having a more comprehensive dataset, including past sales trends, would allow for more precise predictions of future demand patterns.

### Suggestions :

* Optimise inventory levels to align with current sales trends and customer preferences, ensuring efficient stock turnover. Evaluate the performance of various products and consider phasing out or revising strategies for underperforming items.

* Leverage predictive analytics insights to refine inventory management, aiming to minimise overstock and stockouts, thereby optimising inventory costs and availability.

* Create and implement marketing campaigns that are specifically tailored based on the insights from the customer demographic analysis. This should involve customising product offerings and marketing messages to align with the preferences of different customer segments.

* Use targeted marketing to enhance customer engagement and loyalty, thereby driving sales and improving the overall customer experience.

* Initiate a comprehensive review of supplier performance, focusing on areas such as lead time reduction and quality control improvements. This may involve supplier development programs or seeking alternative suppliers.

* Investigate strategies to reduce manufacturing and shipping costs. This could include renegotiating contracts with existing suppliers or exploring new supplier relationships that offer more favorable terms.

* Conduct a thorough reassessment of existing logistics strategies, with a focus on adopting the most cost-effective transportation modes and routes.

* Explore the feasibility of multimodal transportation solutions, considering their potential to optimise the balance between cost, speed, and reliability.

* Implement a regular review process for logistics operations to ensure they remain efficient and cost-effective over time. This may also involve adapting to changing market conditions or leveraging new logistics technologies and methodologies.
